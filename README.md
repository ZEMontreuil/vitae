I began this project in the summer of 2020 to attempt to write a fully functional full-stack application, using exlusively Javascript packages. 
The ongoing result is an application that puts a spin on the classic React example of the todo list, designed to mitigate some of the pain and trepidation around creating a CV.

While I created this project to help sharpen and demonstrate my abilities with React, and learn my way around Express, there are many features I would like to implement as the
project continues to grow, mutate, and hopefully become fully sentient.

I also used this project as the basis for teaching collaboration and some new full-stack technologies for early software development students at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technologies.
