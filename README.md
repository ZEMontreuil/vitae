I began this project in the summer of 2020 to attempt to write a fully functional full-stack application, using exlusively Javascript packages. 
The ongoing result is an application that puts a spin on the classic React example of the todo list, designed to mitigate some of the pain and trepidation around creating a CV.

While I created this project to help sharpen and demonstrate my abilities with React, and learn my way around Express, there are many features I would like to implement as the
project continues to grow, mutate, and hopefully become fully sentient.

Currently, the App uses a MySQL database to store information sent and received by an Express server API. This API works with the React front end to handle basic CRUD functionality.

The main features planned for the future are individual user accounts and a refactor of the front end to employ Hooks.

I also used this project as the basis for teaching collaboration and some new full-stack technologies for early software development students at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technologies.
